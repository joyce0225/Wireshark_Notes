# Wireshark Exercise: Analyzing Agent Tesla Malware Traffic

**Objective:**
Gain hands-on experience in analyzing Agent Tesla malware traffic using Wireshark and identify key indicators of malicious traffic.

**Prerequisites:**
- Wireshark installed.
- Access to the pcap file from malware-traffic-analysis.net.

**Procedure:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
    - Download the Agent Tesla pcap file from [malware-traffic-analysis.net](https://github.com/pan-unit42/Wireshark-quizzes/blob/main/2023-01-Unit42-Wireshark-quiz.pcap.zip).
    - Open it in Wireshark.

2. **Time Display Adjustment:**
    - Set the time display to UTC (View → Time Display Format → UTC Time of Day).

3. **Malicious Traffic Identification:**
    - Determine the start time by analyzing the initial DNS and TCP conversations.

4. **Victim's IP Address:**
    - Under Statistics → Conversations → IPv4, identify the IP address involved in all conversations.

5. **MAC Address Determination:**
    - Go to Statistics → Conversations → Ethernet and note the top talker's MAC address.

6. **Windows Host Name Discovery:**
    - Use the filter frame matches "desktop" to find the default Windows machine name.

7. **User Account Name Extraction:**
    - Follow a relevant TCP Stream to locate and note the user account name.

8. **System Information Gathering:**
    - Within the TCP stream, find details about the system's RAM and CPU.

9. **External IP and Credentials Leakage:**
    - Identify the external IP address and observe leaked credentials in the TCP stream.

10. **Decoding Base64 Encoded Data:**
    - Decode encoded login and password information from SMTP details using Base64.

**Conclusion:**
This exercise equips you with the skills to dissect a pcap file for Agent Tesla malware, focusing on start time, victim's details, system info, and decoding credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- Compare your findings with the provided answer key for accuracy.
- The steps may vary based on different pcap files.
